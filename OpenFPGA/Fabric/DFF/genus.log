  Message Summary for Library sg13g2_stdcell_typ_1p20V_25C.lib:
  *************************************************************
  Missing a function attribute in the output pin definition. [LBR-518]: 1
  An unsupported construct was detected in this library. [LBR-40]: 6
  *************************************************************
 
Info    : Created nominal operating condition. [LBR-412]
        : Operating condition '_nominal_' was created for the PVT values (1.000000, 1.200000, 25.000000) in library 'sg13g2_stdcell_typ_1p20V_25C.lib'.
        : The nominal operating condition is represented, either by the nominal PVT values specified in the library source (via nom_process,nom_voltage and nom_temperature respectively), or by the default PVT values (1.0,1.0,1.0).
Warning : Library cell has no output pins defined. [LBR-9]
        : Library cell 'sg13g2_antennanp' must have an output pin.
        : Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the library. Else the library cell will be marked as timing model i.e. unusable. Timing_model means that the cell does not have any defined function. If there is no output pin, Genus will mark library cell as unusable i.e. the attribute 'usable' will be marked to 'false' on the libcell. Therefore, the cell is not used for mapping and it will not be picked up from the library for synthesis. If you query the attribute 'unusable_reason' on the libcell; result will be: 'Library cell has no output pins.'Note: The message LBR-9 is only for the logical pins and not for the power_ground pins. Genus will depend upon the output function defined in the pin group (output pin) of the cell, to use it for mapping. The pg_pin will not have any function defined.

This warning happens because a particular library cell is defined as 'clock_gating_integrated_cell', but 'dont_use' attribute is defined as true in the liberty library.

|LBR-9   |Warning|   14|Library cell has no output pins defined.          |
|        |       |     |Add the missing output pin(s)                     |
|        |       |     | , then reload the library. Else the library cell |
|        |       |     | will be marked as timing model i.e. unusable.    |
|        |       |     | Timing_model means that the cell does not have   |
|        |       |     | any defined function. If there is no output pin, |
|        |       |     | Genus will mark library cell as unusable i.e. the|
|        |       |     | attribute 'usable' will be marked to 'false' on  |
|        |       |     | the libcell. Therefore, the cell is not used for |
|        |       |     | mapping and it will not be picked up from the    |
|        |       |     | library for synthesis. If you query the attribute|
|        |       |     | 'unusable_reason' on the libcell; result will be:|
|        |       |     | 'Library cell has no output pins.'Note: The      |
|        |       |     | message LBR-9 is only for the logical pins and   |
|        |       |     | not for the power_ground pins. Genus will depend |
|        |       |     | upon the output function defined in the pin group|
|        |       |     | (output pin)                                     |
|        |       |     | of the cell, to use it for mapping. The pg_pin   |
|        |       |     | will not have any function defined.              |

|        |       |     |Check to see if this construct is really needed   |
|        |       |     | for synthesis. Many liberty constructs are not   |
|        |       |     | actually required.                               |
|LBR-41  |Info   |    1|An output library pin lacks a function attribute. |
|        |       |     |If the remainder of this library cell's semantic  |

|LBR-101 |Warning|    2|Unusable clock gating integrated cell found at the|
|        |       |     | time of loading libraries. This warning happens  |
|        |       |     | because a particular library cell is defined as  |
|        |       |     | 'clock_gating_integrated_cell', but 'dont_use'   |
|        |       |     | attribute is defined as true in the liberty      |
|        |       |     | library. To make Genus use this cell for clock   |
|        |       |     | gating insertion, 'dont_use' attribute should be |
|        |       |     | set to false.                                    |
|        |       |     |To make the cell usable, change the value of      |

Error   : Unable to map design without a suitable flip-flop. [MAP-2] [map_library_sanity_check]
        : The instance 'q_reg_reg' requires an async clear flip-flop. Consider setting the lbr_seq_in_out_phase_opto attribute to resolve the async control requirements.
        : Check the libraries for necessary flop cell. You can query using the 'is_flop' attribute on libcells to know which libcells the tool recognized as flop. If the flop cell exists in the library, query using the 'unusable_reason' attribute on the libcell to know why the tool marked it as unusable.
